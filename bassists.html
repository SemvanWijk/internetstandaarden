        <h1>Bassists</h1>
        <img src="/Images/geezerr.jpeg" class="left">
        <p>A bassist is a musician who plays a bass instrument such as a double bass, bass guitar, synthbass,
            keyboard bass or a low brass instrument such as a tuba or trombone. Different musical genres tend to
            be associated with one or more of these instruments. Since the 1960s, the electric bass has been the
            standard bass instrument for funk, R&B, soul music, rock and roll, reggae, jazz fusion, heavy metal,
            country and pop music. </p>

        <p>Electric bassists play the bass guitar. In most rock, pop, metal and country genres, the bass line
            outlines the harmony of the music being performed, while simultaneously indicating the rhythmic
            pulse. In addition, there are many different standard bass line types for different genres and types
            of song. Bass lines often emphasize the root note, with a secondary role for the third, and fifth of
            each chord being used in a given song. In addition, pedal tones, ostinatos, and bass riffs are also
            used as bass lines. </p>
