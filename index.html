                <h1>What is Bass?</h1>

                <!-- Grotendeels van de informatie komt van https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_guitar-->
                <p>The bass guitar, electric bass or simply bass, is the lowest-pitched member of the string family. It
                    is a plucked string instrument similar in appearance and construction to an electric or an acoustic
                    guitar, but with a longer neck and scale length, and typically four to six strings or courses. Since
                    the mid-1950s, the bass guitar has largely replaced the double bass in popular music.</p>
                <p>The four-string bass is usually tuned the same as the double bass, which corresponds to pitches one
                    octave lower than the four lowest-pitched strings of a guitar (typically E, A, D, and G). It is
                    played primarily with the fingers or thumb, or with a pick. To be heard at normal performance
                    volumes, electric basses require external amplification.</p>
                <h2>Terminology</h2>
                <p>According to the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, an "Electric bass guitar [is] a Guitar,
                    usually with four heavy strings tuned E1'–A1'–D2–G2." It also defines bass as "Bass (iv). A
                    contraction of Double bass or Electric bass guitar." According to some authors the proper term is
                    "electric bass".Common names for the instrument are "bass guitar", "electric bass guitar", and
                    "electric bass" and some authors claim that they are historically accurate.</p>
