                <h1>The history of Bass</h1>
                <p>In the 1930s, musician and inventor Paul Tutmarc of Seattle, Washington, developed the first electric
                    bass guitar in its modern form, a fretted instrument designed to be played horizontally. The 1935
                    sales catalog for Tutmarc's company Audiovox featured his "Model 736 Bass Fiddle", a solid-bodied
                    electric bass guitar with four strings, a 30+1⁄2-inch (775-millimetre) scale length, and a single
                    pickup. Around 100 were made during this period. Audiovox also sold their "Model 236" bass
                    amplifier.</p>

                <p>In the 1950s, Leo Fender and George Fullerton developed the first mass-produced electric bass guitar.
                    The Fender Electric Instrument Manufacturing Company began producing the Precision Bass, or P-Bass,
                    in October 1951. The design featured a simple uncontoured "slab" body design and a single coil
                    pickup similar to that of a Telecaster. By 1957 the Precision more closely resembled the Fender
                    Stratocaster with the body edges beveled for comfort, and the pickup was changed to a split coil
                    design.</p>
                    <img src="/Images/gibson.jpeg" class="left">
                <p>The Fender Bass was a revolutionary instrument for gigging musicians. In comparison with the large,
                    heavy upright bass, which had been the main bass instrument in popular music from the early 20th
                    century to the 1940s, the bass guitar could be easily transported to shows. When amplified, the bass
                    guitar was also less prone than acoustic basses to unwanted audio feedback. The addition of frets
                    enabled bassists to play in tune more easily than on fretless acoustic or electric upright basses,
                    and allowed guitarists to more easily transition to the instrument.</p>
                <p>In 1953, Gibson released the first short-scale violin-shaped electric bass, the EB-1, with an
                    extendable end pin so a bassist could play it upright or horizontally. In 1958, Gibson released the
                    maple arched-top EB-2 described in the Gibson catalog as a "hollow-body".</p>
