        <h1>Types of Bass</h1>
        <h2>Fretless Bass</h2>
        <img src="/Images/fret3.png" class="left">
        <p>While electric bass guitars are traditionally fretted instruments, fretless bass guitars are used by
            some players to achieve different tones, as well as playing additional micro tones. In 1961, Rolling
            Stones bassist Bill Wyman converted a used UK-built Dallas Tuxedo bass by removing the frets and
            filling in the slots with wood putty.</p>
        <p>The lack of frets allows for more fluid slides between notes, but also requires greater precision by
            the player, as the instrument may sound out of tune if notes are not fretted accurately. While some
            have "fret lines" indicating where the players should place their fingers for correct intonation,
            other basses may only have inlay dots or nothing at all on the fingerboard. While many fretless
            players use flatwound strings as they are believed to not wear down on the neck as much as
            roundwounds, some players are mainly known for using roundwound strings to gain a brighter tone.</p>
        <h2>Acoustic Bass</h2>
        <img src="/Images/acoustic bass.jpeg" class="right">
        <p>The acoustic bass guitar is a bass instrument with a hollow wooden body similar to a steel-string acoustic
            guitar. Like the traditional electric bass guitar and the double
            bass, the acoustic bass guitar commonly has four strings, which are normally tuned E-A-D-G, an
            octave below the lowest four strings of the 6-string guitar, which is the same tuning pitch as an
            electric bass guitar.</p>
        <p>Because it can sometimes be difficult to hear an acoustic bass guitar without an amplifier, even in
            settings with other acoustic instruments, most acoustic basses have pickups, either magnetic or
            piezoelectric or both, so that they can be amplified with a bass amp.</p>
